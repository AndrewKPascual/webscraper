MERIDIAN, Miss. (October 2020) — Two administrators from CCA’s Central Region were recently recognized by the Mississippi Department of Education.

During the MSDE’s annual State of Our Schools meeting held virtually this year, Steve Miller, CCA’s Director of Federal Programs Administration, and Dr. Deborah Austin, CCA’s Assistant Regional Superintendent, were both included in the Service Honoree video that was featured during the meeting.

The video recognized employees across the state for their efforts during the pandemic.

Miller said, “It was quite nice to be recognized by the MSDE. It’s a testament to the whole CCA family who are working hard to provide a quality education to the students in our region.”
