As an AI, I can analyze the text content of a website's HTML code and provide a summary of the information presented. However, I cannot differentiate between HTML code and text content, so I would need to be programmed to identify and exclude the code from my summary. Once the code is removed, I can use natural language processing techniques to generate a concise summary of the website's content.
